# Portfolio Builder

Do you want to create a portfolio of work to help you get that first job?  
Are you learning a new language, and want some structure to guide you?  

Portfolio Builder is a series of exercises to demonstrate your abilities in a new programming language.

## Repo Organization

The list of exercises is below. The details of each exercise (follow the links) are in folder [exercises](exercises).

I'll be gradually completing these exercises in many languages. This is both for my own edification and to provide example solutions. These examples are in folder [solutions](solutions) followed by the language name and then the exercise name.

You will need to create your own repository for your solutions. You don't need to fork from this repo, it's just a reference to read from.

## Caveats

Some of these exercises cannot be completed in all programming languages; for instance, some languages have no GUI support. Just complete what you can.

After the first few exercises, the rest are not strictly ordered by difficulty. Some languages will be better suited to some exercises, and some programmers will find some concepts easier to understand. Feel free to skip around, this is your practice time!

## Exercises

Let's get started!

**90** unassigned  

*(Why do the exercise numbers have gaps? So that more can be added later without disrupting the numbers that are already being referenced.)*

## Language Notes

I keep my own programming language notes [here](https://withouthaste.com). I've found the practice of keeping notes really helpful over the years, and recommend you find a method that works well for you.
